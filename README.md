## Proposal protocol open to EveryONE in Fulton 
  make a proposal as any age, class, gender, race, or token holder status.  Just be a citizen of the jurisdiction.

## Local policy voting
  Everyone gets one vote holding the tiered power stated above.  All extra tokens are pooled together for the quadratic round and you will not have control over any more wealth than your one vote allocates by the qf mechanism.  There are other forms of wealth that are more privatized.  this is not one.  if you hold community tokens it's because you want the community to do well, not because you want to control its outcome.  Your outcome control lies solely in your individual vote, and your ability to make proposals even without voting power.  Your credit is the proposal that is stamped with your wallet!  So your ideas will automatically be notarized upon proposition!

## Local project voting and quadratic funding mechanism
  citizens vote concurrently and funding is rolled out frequently.  Just like zuckbook's like mechanism - projects can be defunded immediately, and funded immediatley - in as much as they gain/lose support.  This functionality could be controlled to allow riskier projects the option to fund/defund rapidly, or perhaps to thwart any attempt of sudden new populations coming to hijack the local community organized wealth.

## Historical Record
  A place where community members go to review past projects, who proposed them, any data they collected, and their present condition
  
  
## Research funding
  Abstract funding for local educational and research endeavors that have no immediate impact on the community, but which have been voted on and determined by the community to be worth allocating funds toward for long term sustainability and success.
